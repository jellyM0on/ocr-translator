<h1>jpOCR</h1>

<p>This project is an Electron app which recognizes and translates Japanese text from a user-selected desktop window. It uses Tesseract.js as its OCR Engine and a local LibreTranslate server for translation. Desktop interactions are dependent on Electron's desktopCapturer module. </p>
